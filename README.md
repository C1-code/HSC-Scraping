# HSC-Scraping
This is a collection of tools to gain more resources and insight into the NSW HSC. 

The first tool scrapes the distinguished achievers list (the list of students who achieved 90+ in their respective subjects) and generates csv files for the data for each year. 
1. Download the executable file from the "Distinguished Achievers Scraping" folder labelled ```Data.exe```
2. Place it in its own folder, let's say its called ```Test```. Within ```Test``` there should be a folder (blank or otherwise) labelled ```data```
```
C:.
│   README.md

├───Distinguished Achievers Scraping
│   │   Data.exe
│   │   Data.py
│   │
│   └───data
```
3. Double click the executable!

The second tool scrapes the popular THSC Online website for maths past papers, from 2019-2022 (current year, to accomodate for the syllabus change), then downloads them into the folder the program is run. 
The setup instructions is identical to the first tool, although no ```data``` folder is needed.
